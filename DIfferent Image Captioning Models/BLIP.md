### BLIP

-  BLIP stands Bottom-Up Image Parsing for Dense Image Captioning.
-  It focuses on generating multiple captions for different regions within an image, providing a more detailed and comprehensive description.
-  BLIP uses a bottom-up approach to parse the image into regions of interest and then generates captions for each of these regions which allows for a richer and more detailed understanding of the image content, making it particularly useful for applications where detailed image descriptions are required.
