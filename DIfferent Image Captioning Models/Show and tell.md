## Show and Tell Image Captioning Model

- It uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) as the encoder to extract visual features from the input image. These visual features are then fed into a recurrent neural network (RNN), typically a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, which serves as the decoder to generate captions based on the extracted features.
- The "Show and Tell" model follows an end-to-end approach, where the CNN and RNN are trained jointly to learn the mapping between images and their corresponding captions.
